1. What is a lesson you learned during this lab? You do not have to restrict
   your response to Python. It might be a lesson in time management, a lesson
   using CodeGrade, or something else.

I learned that if a code is saved into a certain function by defining it, it can be used 
over again any time withiout having to rewrite the whole code all over again.
